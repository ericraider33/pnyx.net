  0. Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 1 of the Pnyx.net Software 
  Lincense.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  "Derivative Libary" refers to modifications to The Libary
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version". For the purposes of this License, Combined Work includes
command-line usage of The Library.

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  Public distributions of The Library, either as source code or binary code,
are stictly forbidden. Only BuckTheOdds, LLC. and its associated business 
partners may distribute The Library.

  2. Fee For Usage
  
  Usages of The Library are restricted based upon a fee schedule. Fees apply to

schedules are not part of the scope of this document. However, fees are based
upon 3 different types of usage: 1) fee per machine, 2) fee per project and/or
3) fee per developer. In each case, BuckTheOdds LLC. has the right to waive fees
either temporarily or permently. Fee schedules are detailed in addendums to this
license agreement.

  3. Derivative Libary
  
  Changes to The Libary software are permitted. Source code for the project can
be used and modified. Derivative Libaries may be privately distributed and privately
included within other projects. Derivative Libary and distribution thereof is covered
by Fees for Usage. All of terms of this agreement apply to Derivative Libaries unless
specifically noted otherwise. All Derivative Libaries must also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Derivative Libary that
   the Library is basis of the resultant libary and that the Library and 
   its use are covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Derivative Libary with a copy of this license
   document.

   c) Pay Fee for Usage on behalf of usage of the Derivative Libary.
  
  4. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you must convey a copy of the modified
version to BuckTheOdds LLC. Source code of the modifications must be 
submitting via email (or other means mutually agreed upon) to 
support@bucktheodds.com.
  
  5. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of this license
   document.

   c) Pay Fee for Usage on behalf of usage of the Combined Work.
   

  6. Revised Versions of The License.

of the License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar 
in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to 
address new problems or concerns.

are published, all previous versions become obsolete and the latest version 
will be legally binding for all usage of The Libary that occur after the
publish date. All registered customers using The Libary will be notified of
